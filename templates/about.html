	<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Diverse Sources is a searchable database of underrepresented experts in the areas of science, health and the environment. Anyone who considers themselves underrepresented and is willing to respond to journalists on deadline is encouraged to join (including but not limited to appearance, ethnicity, gender expression, gender identity, language, mental health experience, nationality, physical abilities, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, etc.).</p>
		<p>This database aims to make it easy for journalists and others to include a wider range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives in their work. By doing so, we can improve our coverage and better reflect the world we cover.</p>

	<h3>Testimonials</h3>
		<blockquote>"I told some friends of mine about this, and one signed up and was just quoted in the Washington Post. Keep doing great work!" &mdash;Sally, bioengineer</blockquote>

		<blockquote>"I spoke with NPR recently, and credit it to diversesources. Thanks!" &mdash;Liz, social psychologist</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“Working on an article about the uses of VR and got some help from @DiverseSources on finding a couple good ones.” &mdash;Andrew, freelance journalist</blockquote>

		<blockquote>“I love Diverse Sources. It makes including new voices in my science stories so much easier—even when writing on deadline. And I believe that our stories get better when we don’t quote from the same small pool of experts again and again.” &mdash;Carla, science journalist</blockquote>
